function is executed based on some events.

Eg:
<input type="submit" class="btn" value="{{ btnText }}" (click)="addItem()">

That's where event binding comes in. 
We can use event binding to capture a variety of user-initiated events to initiate logic in our component class. 
Angular 5 supports many events listed here.
