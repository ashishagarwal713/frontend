The {{ }} contains JavaScript which is run by Angular and the output inserted in the HTML.

Whenever you need to communicate properties (variables, objects, arrays, etc..) from the component class to the template, you can use interpolation.

Important Points:
1 - returns only string
2 - functions can also be passed and it must return string 

content between {{ propertyName }} should be a instance variable in its component


Eg:
So if we put {{ 1 + 1 }} in the template the number 2 would be inserted into the HTML.
